## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Marketing startegies have shifted drastically through the years into data centric approaches to deliver targeted advertisemnt and offers to customers for maximum profitability. Starbucks coffee is not an exception as they are moving towards a digital market space in their new rewards mobile app. I will be using simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to find out which customers respond best to which offer. There are three types of offers, buy one get one free (BOGO), discount, and informational.
